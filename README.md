# examination_result_portal project flow:
When we open a project, the first page that appears is the login page. If we already have an account, we can log in.
However, if we don't have an account, we need to create one first. On the login page, there is a "create account" link. 
Clicking on this link will redirect us to the registration page where we can create an account using our username, email address, password and confirm password. 
The password must contain at least one digit, one special character and one uppercase letter, otherwise, it will show an error. 
If the confirm password and password do not match, it will also show an error. 
If all conditions are okay, it will create an account and redirect us to the login page where we can log in. If the username and password match, it will log us in. 
However, if they do not match, it will show an "invalid" error. Once we log in, it will redirect us to the main page.
When we enter the main page, there is a navbar that contains different types of links such as "nth," "10TH," "intermediate," "degree," and "BTech". 
If we click on the "nth" link, it will redirect us to the main page. However, if we click on the "10TH" link, it will redirect us to the "result check" page.
On this page, there is a form where we can enter our hall ticket number. If the hall ticket number is correct, it will display the result.
Otherwise, it will show an error message saying "invalid hall ticket." The remaining links will have the same functionality in the same manner.
